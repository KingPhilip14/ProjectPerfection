This is a text-based RPG I started as a freshman in college to practice some of the things I learned in my courses.

I know that much of the code here is not optimized; however, I have learned much through working on this and other projects. When the main game of this is done, I plan to revisit the main concepts of this project and rebuild it in a way that is cleaner and more secure.
